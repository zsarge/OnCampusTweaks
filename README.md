# OnCampusTweaks
#### Change the way Elder High School's student website behaves.

This is a Tampermonkey script that aims to fix some issues I have had with Blackbaud's OnCampus system.

> You can get Tampermonkey at [tampermonkey.net](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

Current Features:   
-  Automatically hides completed tasks
    - By default, the assignment center loads all completed and graded tasks
        - This is just unnecessary information
- Automatically changes to week view
    - This is a personal preference
    
Planned Features:
- Add button to calculate weighted & unweighted GPA
